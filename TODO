[ ] consider paginating the /user/data endpoint response
[ ] paginate the workouts in the history view
[ ] change the apk icon to the one i set
[ ] search using incomplete terms (not have to type the whole name)
[ ] populate the food database with the contents of another food database, so we don't have to define foods from scratch
[ ] add screenshots of the app to the readme (repost on hackernews)
[ ] update the meal item tags when you edit the meal
[ ] show loading icon on buttons
[ ] restyle all the workout pages, overhaul the styling completely (shouldn't look terrible)
[ ] Also add button to optionally record cardio session (should we time workout sessions also)
[ ] Implement custom line graph and heatmap components (use svg for drawing)
